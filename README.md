# Learning Git
This is just a throw-away repo I'll be using to follow various tutorials so that I can maybe learn this damned Git thing...
This will be made difficult because of my lack of a proper tool set . I'm using powershell . . . 
 
# Update No.1
I said screw dealing with Windows Powershell and installed Cygwin. I know it isn't a proper linux but at least this way I have have a sane shell and some decent cli text editors to use.
